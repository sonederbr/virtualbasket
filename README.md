Virtual basket.

# Task
Please implement C# code that calculates the total price of a given collection of
items. The solution should support applying discount rules.
Specifically, a “buy two, get one free” deal for certain items or combinations of
certain items must be implemented
For example, if a “buy two, get one free” promotion is enabled for apples and
oranges, when buying two apples and one orange, payment for 2 of the items would
be required.

# Notes
The implementation should be a fully working maintainable pricing solution that is of
production quality
This task doesn’t require implementing a shopping basket, an eCommerce web site
or a console application
As a guideline, please aim to spend about two hours working on a solution for this
task
